Hi! I'm Eric Gustavsson. I'm an open source advocate and a viking/Swede that is currently suffering in the heat of Czech Republic. 
Born and raised in Sundsvall, Sweden and then studied at Lule√• University of Technology which is close to the polar circle.  

I have two reasons for living in Czech Republic, my girlfriend lives and works here, and I'm currently employed at Red Hat here in Brno as a software engineer. 

Whenever I get the chance I try to contribute to any open source projects, a few that come to mind is 
[Valkyrja](https://www.valkyrja.app/),
[snoowrap](https://github.com/not-an-aardvark/snoowrap),
[PatternFly React](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-react),
[toolbox](https://github.com/toolbox-team/reddit-moderator-toolbox), and
[EDAssets](https://edassets.org/).

I also try to learn the next big thing with front-end development.
